## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing X's and O's on the board
- The goal is to get 5 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- Block rule (optional):
  - When enabled, having both ends of a line of 5 blocked by opponent's pieces doesn't count as a win
  - This adds strategic depth to the game
- First player uses 'X', second player uses 'O'
- Game ends when either:
  - A player gets 5 in a row
  - The board is completely filled (draw)
